## Context
* This project represents my results for the programming challenge Advent of Code.
* The primary Programming Language used is Pascal
* The dialect is Turbo Pascal 7 compatible
* The programs are intended to run on the following platforms:
    * 8086 DOS 3.31
    * 386 DOS 6.2
    * 486 DOS 6.2
    * ATARI ST
* The soultions must be as efficent and memory saving as possible to support the above listed platforms
* Runtime of the choosen algorithms is a key factor to get soulutions in a resonable time
* Only libraries provided by Turbo Pascal are allowed, everything else must be written from scratch
* The program should be written in a way that it can be run on any of the above listed platforms idealy without any modifications
* ECSS Codingrules for Space Software apply
